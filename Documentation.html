<h2>LOST DRAGON HISTORY</h2>
  

  <div class="detail">
  
 <p>Dong Nguyen a Vietnamese programmer designed a side-scroller game called ‘Flappy Bird’. Players try to control the bird in struggling to fly between the green pipes without hitting the pipes or the ground, the bird only fly from left to right. If the player hit the screen (or button)the bird flaps upward and if the player does not hit the screen the bird fall due to the gravity. There are different points and medals in passing the pipes, the gold medal will be awarded if the player passed all first thirty pipes. There is a same gap between the pipes but the height of the pipes changes all the time.
 <p>

The game was launched in year 2013 and listed as the most downloaded game by the end of January 2014, started to make around $50,000 a day in application downloads and advertisements. This game was highly addictive in nature and that is the reason Dong Nguyen removed the game from the App store and Google play.

<p>

<h2>SCOPE OF THE PROJECT</h2>
  
  <p>
  Our team’s target is to develop the game with better performance and attractive interface for the game players. We will test all the modules of the game and compare it with the real ‘Flappy Bird’. The real game is challenging but it gets bored by the time, with our team’s enhancement in’ Lost Dragon’ there would be better interface and performance of the game. The scoring system of the game also modifies including better reward system.
We will use the simplified source code as compare to the real game. Enhance the gaming algorithm for collision detection, scoring, loading, sequence of instance and control.
We will introduce a nice visual and audio relationship in the game, so user could easily play the game. Awkward combination of visual and audio cause distraction in the mind of the player. ‘Leaderboard’ would help us to make the player comeback to the website for competition, without any commercial advertisements.
